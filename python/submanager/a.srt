1
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,762
<i>Three billion human lives ended
on August 29, 1997.</i>

2
00:01:18,917 --> 00:01:21,186
<i>The survivors of the nuclear fire...</i>

3
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,872
<i>called the war 'Judgment Day'.</i>

4
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,909
<i>They lived only to face
a new nightmare--</i>

5
00:01:26,949 --> 00:01:28,924
<i>the war against the machines.</i>

6
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:47,522
<i>The computer which controlled
the machines, Skynet...</i>

7
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:50,460
<i>sent two Terminators
back through time.</i>

8
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:54,431
<i>Their mission: to destroy the leader
of the human resistance...</i>

9
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:56,991
<i>John Connor, my son.</i>

10
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:03,260
<i>The first Terminator was programmed
to strike at me...</i>

11
00:03:03,303 --> 00:03:05,212
<i>in the year 1984...</i>

12
00:03:05,255 --> 00:03:07,524
<i>before John was born.</i>

13
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,349
<i>lt failed.</i>

14
00:03:09,383 --> 00:03:12,165
<i>The second was set to strike
at John himself...</i>

15
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,588
<i>when he was still a child.</i>

16
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:21,730
<i>As before, the resistance was able
to send a lone warrior...</i>

17
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:24,005
<i>a protector for John.</i>

18
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,334
<i>lt was just a question of which one
of them would reach him first.</i>

19
00:07:31,628 --> 00:07:34,727
I need your clothes, your boots
and your motorcycle.

20
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:45,421
You forgot to say 'please'.

21
00:08:00,462 --> 00:08:02,088
Get him off me!

22
00:08:21,743 --> 00:08:26,120
Pull it out!

23
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,541
Take it.

24
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:13,479
Can't let you take
the man's wheels, son.

25
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,269
Now, get off
before I put you down.

26
00:09:24,783 --> 00:09:27,086
That's it, goddamn it.

27
00:10:25,137 --> 00:10:27,374
R-31 David, Sherman Code 6...

28
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:31,205
at the Sixth Street Bridge and Santa Fe
on electrical disturbance.

29
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:34,380
<i>Ten-four, R-31 David.</i>

30
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,155
John, get in there and clean up
that pigsty of yours.

31
00:12:21,204 --> 00:12:23,343
Your foster parents
are kind of dicks, huh?

32
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,609
I swear, I have had it
with that goddamn kid.

33
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,230
- He won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey, move.

34
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:32,117
Would you get off your butt
and help me?

35
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:34,898
- Todd!
- What?

36
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:38,195
He hasn't cleaned that room of his
in a month.

37
00:12:38,229 --> 00:12:41,262
Oh, it's an emergency.
Hang on. I'll get right on it.

38
00:12:48,628 --> 00:12:50,352
Come on.

39
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:53,520
Get your ass inside.
Do what your mother tells you.

40
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:57,298
She's not my mother, Todd.

41
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:24,335
This next patient is interesting.

42
00:13:24,373 --> 00:13:26,762
I've been following the case
for years.

43
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,845
A 29-year-old female...

44
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:33,648
diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

45
00:13:33,686 --> 00:13:36,850
The usual indicators: depression,
anxiety, violent acting out...

46
00:13:36,886 --> 00:13:38,577
delusions of persecution.

47
00:13:44,694 --> 00:13:47,986
The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.

48
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:50,768
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator...

49
00:13:50,803 --> 00:13:53,553
which looks human, of course,
was sent back through time...

50
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,105
- to kill her.
- That's original.

51
00:13:56,146 --> 00:13:59,278
And also that the father
of her child...

52
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:02,509
was a soldier sent back
to protect her.

53
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:04,433
He was from the future too.

54
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:08,938
The year 2029,
if I remember correctly.

55
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:11,116
And here we are.

56
00:14:11,858 --> 00:14:12,937
<i>Morning, Sarah.</i>

57
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:20,880
Good morning, Dr. Silberman.
How's the knee?

58
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:24,529
<i>Fine, Sarah.</i>

59
00:14:25,586 --> 00:14:27,789
She stabbed me in the kneecap...

60
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:31,241
with my pen a few weeks ago.

61
00:14:31,281 --> 00:14:32,710
Repeated escape attempts.

62
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,784
Let's move on, shall we?

63
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:48,047
I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

64
00:14:48,082 --> 00:14:51,506
- See she takes her Thorazine.
- Sure. I'll take care of it.

65
00:15:03,538 --> 00:15:06,538
It's time to take your meds, Connor.

66
00:15:06,578 --> 00:15:08,269
You take it.

67
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,736
Now you know you gotta be good...

68
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:11,567
because you're up for review
this afternoon.

69
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:15,312
I'm not taking it, Dougie.
I don't want any trouble.

70
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,426
Ain't no trouble.

71
00:15:22,452 --> 00:15:23,499
Yeah, zap her.

72
00:15:33,652 --> 00:15:35,594
Last call, sugar.

73
00:15:41,332 --> 00:15:43,274
Sweet dreams.

74
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:13,196
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

75
00:16:14,034 --> 00:16:17,164
That's right, Officer.
What's he done now?

76
00:16:17,201 --> 00:16:20,071
- Could I speak with him, please?
- You could if he were here.

77
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:22,895
He took off on his bike this morning.
He could be anywhere.

78
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:25,199
Do you have a photograph of John?

79
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,444
Yeah. Hold on.

80
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:31,436
Gonna tell me what this is about?

81
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:33,962
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

82
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:38,768
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

83
00:16:38,803 --> 00:16:42,185
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him too.

84
00:16:42,226 --> 00:16:44,364
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.

85
00:16:44,402 --> 00:16:46,769
Has that got something
to do with this?

86
00:16:49,938 --> 00:16:52,938
I wouldn't worry about him.

87
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,728
Thanks for your cooperation.

88
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,567
Please insert your stolen card now.

89
00:17:06,515 --> 00:17:08,206
PIN number.

90
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:10,923
Hurry up. This is taking too long.

91
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,424
Go, baby.

92
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,337
All right.

93
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,992
- PIN number 9003.
- Where'd you learn this stuff from?

94
00:17:19,027 --> 00:17:21,449
From my mom.
My real mom, I mean.

95
00:17:21,492 --> 00:17:25,616
Withdraw 300 bucks.

96
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:28,369
Come on, baby. Come on!

97
00:17:28,404 --> 00:17:30,608
- Yes!
- Hey, it worked.

98
00:17:30,644 --> 00:17:34,603
All right. Easy money.
Come on!

99
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,600
Yes! Piece of cake.

100
00:17:43,632 --> 00:17:46,666
- Is that her?
- Yes.

101
00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:48,527
She's pretty cool, huh?

102
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:50,764
No, she's a complete psycho.

103
00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:53,419
That's why she's at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute.

104
00:17:55,057 --> 00:17:58,025
She tried to blow up a computer factory
but got shot and arrested.

105
00:17:58,065 --> 00:18:00,071
No shit.

106
00:18:00,752 --> 00:18:03,086
She's a total loser.

107
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,738
Come on.
Let's go spend some money.

108
00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:32,685
Sarah...

109
00:18:33,617 --> 00:18:35,472
Sarah, wake up.

110
00:18:42,258 --> 00:18:43,915
Kyle.

111
00:18:46,546 --> 00:18:47,855
You're dead.

112
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,864
Where's our son, Sarah?

113
00:18:50,802 --> 00:18:53,006
They took him away from me.

114
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:56,140
- He's the target now.
- I know.

115
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,218
He's all alone
and you have to protect him.

116
00:18:58,258 --> 00:19:00,626
I know.

117
00:19:00,658 --> 00:19:03,178
You tell me
how I'm supposed to do that.

118
00:19:03,219 --> 00:19:05,324
He doesn't even believe me anymore.

119
00:19:05,362 --> 00:19:09,257
- I've lost him.
- You're strong, Sarah.

120
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:11,687
Stronger than you ever thought
you could be.

121
00:19:12,627 --> 00:19:14,056
On your feet, soldier!

122
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:17,426
I love you, Sarah.

123
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:19,662
I always will.

124
00:19:20,914 --> 00:19:22,027
I need you.

125
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:23,725
I'll always be with you.

126
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:30,825
Remember the message?

127
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:32,656
The future is not set.

128
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,168
There is no fate
but what we make for ourselves.

129
00:19:56,339 --> 00:19:58,227
Stay with me.

130
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,875
There's not much time left
in the world, Sarah.

131
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:10,761
Kyle, don't go!

132
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:24,362
Kyle!

133
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:36,747
<i>lt's like a giant strobe light...</i>

134
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:39,058
<i>burning right through my eyes.</i>

135
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:45,291
<i>Somehow I can still see.</i>

136
00:21:50,902 --> 00:21:52,658
<i>Oh, God.</i>

137
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:59,313
<i>We know the dream's the same
every night.</i>

138
00:21:59,347 --> 00:22:02,609
<i>- Why do I have to--
- Please continue.</i>

139
00:22:06,163 --> 00:22:08,814
<i>Children look like burnt paper.</i>

140
00:22:10,355 --> 00:22:12,428
<i>Black.</i>

141
00:22:12,468 --> 00:22:14,355
<i>Not moving.</i>

142
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,418
<i>And then the blast wave hits them.</i>

143
00:22:27,316 --> 00:22:29,935
<i>And they fly apart like leaves.</i>

144
00:22:31,572 --> 00:22:32,685
<i>Dreams...</i>

145
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:34,863
<i>of cataclysm,
the end of the world...</i>

146
00:22:34,901 --> 00:22:36,788
<i>are very common.</i>

147
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:42,480
<i>lt's not a dream, you moron.
lt's real.</i>

148
00:22:42,517 --> 00:22:46,346
<i>- I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels real to you.</i>

149
00:22:46,389 --> 00:22:48,811
<i>On August 29, 1997...</i>

150
00:22:48,853 --> 00:22:52,268
<i>it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin'real to you too!</i>

151
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:56,782
<i>Anybody not wearing two-million
sunblock is gonna have a real bad day.</i>

152
00:22:56,821 --> 00:22:57,804
<i>Get it?</i>

153
00:22:57,845 --> 00:23:00,627
<i>God, you think
you're safe and alive.</i>

154
00:23:00,661 --> 00:23:02,898
<i>You're already dead. Everybody!</i>

155
00:23:02,933 --> 00:23:05,389
<i>Him. You. You're dead already.</i>

156
00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:08,244
<i>This whole place,
everything you see is gone!</i>

157
00:23:08,277 --> 00:23:12,205
<i>You're the one living in the dream,
'cause I know it happened!</i>

158
00:23:12,245 --> 00:23:14,132
<i>lt happened!</i>

159
00:23:24,661 --> 00:23:27,597
I feel much better now.

160
00:23:27,638 --> 00:23:29,493
Clearer.

161
00:23:29,525 --> 00:23:32,242
Yes, your attitude has been...

162
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,514
much improved lately.

163
00:23:43,413 --> 00:23:45,836
It's helped me to have a goal...

164
00:23:45,878 --> 00:23:49,009
something to look forward to.

165
00:23:49,045 --> 00:23:50,158
What is that?

166
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:52,499
Well, you said...

167
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:56,276
that if I showed improvement
after six months...

168
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,896
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing...

169
00:23:58,934 --> 00:24:01,617
and I could have visitors.

170
00:24:03,158 --> 00:24:05,613
Well, it's been six months...

171
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,061
and...

172
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:10,323
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

173
00:24:11,318 --> 00:24:13,206
I see.

174
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:19,858
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

175
00:24:20,952 --> 00:24:24,247
Now you think they don't exist?

176
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,582
They don't exist.

177
00:24:26,616 --> 00:24:28,275
I know that now.

178
00:24:28,312 --> 00:24:31,378
But you've told me on many occasions
about how you crushed one...

179
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:33,456
in a hydraulic press.

180
00:24:34,744 --> 00:24:37,777
If I had, there would have
been some evidence.

181
00:24:37,815 --> 00:24:40,182
They would have found something
at the factory.

182
00:24:40,215 --> 00:24:42,287
I see.

183
00:24:42,328 --> 00:24:45,623
So you don't believe anymore
that the company covered it up?

184
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:50,582
No. Why would they?

185
00:24:50,617 --> 00:24:53,775
Let's try a new position
right there.

186
00:25:03,255 --> 00:25:06,484
Mr. Dyson?

187
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,073
The materials team
is running another--

188
00:25:09,113 --> 00:25:10,737
- Mr. Dyson.
- Yes?

189
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:13,678
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

190
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,590
You have to sign for the-- it.

191
00:25:16,633 --> 00:25:19,382
- You have to sign it out.
- Okay. I'll get it.

192
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:25,170
I know I haven't been here long,
but I was wondering if you know--

193
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:26,550
Know what?

194
00:25:26,585 --> 00:25:29,169
If you know where "it" came from.

195
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:32,524
I asked them the same question once.
You know what they told me?

196
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:34,455
Don't ask.

197
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,055
- Good morning, Mr. Dyson.
- How's it going?

198
00:25:43,097 --> 00:25:45,966
Insert key.
Left on three.

199
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:48,278
Two, one, turn.

200
00:25:51,193 --> 00:25:54,292
- How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

201
00:26:20,282 --> 00:26:23,320
So what do you think, Doctor?

202
00:26:24,153 --> 00:26:26,201
I have shown improvement,
haven't I?

203
00:26:27,226 --> 00:26:29,943
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

204
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,336
I know how smart you are.

205
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,312
You're just telling me
what I want to hear.

206
00:26:36,315 --> 00:26:39,282
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

207
00:26:39,322 --> 00:26:43,064
If I put you in minimum security,
you'll just try to escape again.

208
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:49,942
You have to let me see my son.

209
00:26:51,098 --> 00:26:52,659
Please.

210
00:26:56,442 --> 00:26:59,541
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

211
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:02,288
If I could make a phone call--

212
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:04,720
I'm afraid not.
Not for a while.

213
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:09,231
I don't see any choice but to
recommend to the review board...

214
00:27:09,274 --> 00:27:11,730
that you stay here
for another six months.

215
00:27:14,778 --> 00:27:17,942
I'll kill you,
you son of a bitch!

216
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:20,826
You son of a bitch!

217
00:27:22,234 --> 00:27:25,978
Ten CCs of sodium amobarbital, stat!

218
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,472
You don't know what you're doing!

219
00:27:27,514 --> 00:27:29,587
Get some restraints in here now!

220
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:34,164
You don't know what you're doing!

221
00:27:37,787 --> 00:27:40,056
<i>Model citizen.</i>

222
00:28:17,436 --> 00:28:20,087
You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

223
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:23,223
- He was going to the Galleria.
- Yeah.

224
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,984
The Galleria?

225
00:29:08,317 --> 00:29:11,415
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

226
00:29:25,693 --> 00:29:28,444
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

227
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:34,682
Hey, do you know this guy?

228
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:36,824
Nah, I don't know him.

229
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,253
- John.
- Not now.

230
00:29:44,286 --> 00:29:47,451
There's this cop scoping for you.
Check it out.

231
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:51,742
- He's right over there.
- Split, man.

232
00:29:51,775 --> 00:29:54,164
- Just go.
- Yeah.

233
00:29:58,655 --> 00:29:59,865
I saw that kid--

234
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,447
You're not supposed to
be in here!

235
00:30:41,088 --> 00:30:42,266
Get down.

236
00:31:50,146 --> 00:31:52,218
Mister, are you all right?

237
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:54,491
You all right?

238
00:32:09,121 --> 00:32:10,332
Come on!

239
00:32:48,547 --> 00:32:49,954
Goddamn!

240
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,261
Okay, time-out.
Stop the bike.

241
00:37:20,298 --> 00:37:22,818
Time out.
Come on, stop the bike.

242
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:37,988
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

243
00:37:38,026 --> 00:37:40,360
- You are a Terminator, right?
- Yes.

244
00:37:40,393 --> 00:37:43,111
Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

245
00:37:54,217 --> 00:37:56,105
Holy shit.

246
00:37:57,514 --> 00:38:00,034
You're really real.

247
00:38:00,073 --> 00:38:01,961
I mean--

248
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:07,232
You're like a machine underneath,
right?

249
00:38:07,274 --> 00:38:08,736
But alive outside?

250
00:38:08,778 --> 00:38:10,666
I'm a cybernetic organism.

251
00:38:10,698 --> 00:38:13,316
Living tissue
over metal endoskeleton.

252
00:38:27,499 --> 00:38:29,637
This is intense.

253
00:38:29,675 --> 00:38:32,358
Get a grip, John. Okay.

254
00:38:34,827 --> 00:38:36,900
You're not here to kill me.

255
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:40,770
I figured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

256
00:38:40,812 --> 00:38:43,461
My mission is to protect you.

257
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,052
Yeah? Who sent you?

258
00:38:47,179 --> 00:38:48,324
You did.

259
00:38:48,363 --> 00:38:50,502
35 years from now,
you reprogrammed me...

260
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:52,703
to be your protector here,
in this time.

261
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,038
Oh, this is deep.

262
00:39:17,385 --> 00:39:19,970
So this other guy, he's
a Terminator like you, right?

263
00:39:20,009 --> 00:39:23,937
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

264
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:27,205
More advanced than you are?

265
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:29,827
Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.

266
00:39:29,866 --> 00:39:31,621
What the hell does that mean?

267
00:39:31,657 --> 00:39:33,545
Liquid metal.

268
00:39:34,537 --> 00:39:35,781
Where are we going?

269
00:39:35,818 --> 00:39:38,566
We have to get out of the city
immediately and avoid the authorities.

270
00:39:39,113 --> 00:39:41,763
I gotta stop by my house.
I wanna pick up some stuff.

271
00:39:41,799 --> 00:39:46,403
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.

272
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,128
- You sure?
- I would.

273
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,858
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

274
00:40:04,008 --> 00:40:05,437
but I gotta warn 'em.

275
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,815
Shit. You got a quarter?

276
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:19,104
<i>- Hello.
- Janelle, it's me.</i>

277
00:40:19,145 --> 00:40:21,447
<i>- John?
- Is everything all right?</i>

278
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,848
<i>- Are you guys okay?
- Sure, honey, everything's okay.</i>

279
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:26,881
<i>- Are you all right?
- Yeah, l'm fine.</i>

280
00:40:26,921 --> 00:40:30,401
John, it's late.
I was beginning to worry about you.

281
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,059
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

282
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,624
I'm making beef stew.

283
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:37,535
Something's wrong.
She's never this nice.

284
00:40:37,577 --> 00:40:39,300
Where are you?

285
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:42,152
What the hell is
the goddamn dog barking at?

286
00:40:42,186 --> 00:40:45,349
Hey, shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!

287
00:40:45,385 --> 00:40:46,879
The dog's really barking.

288
00:40:46,921 --> 00:40:49,060
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that mutt.

289
00:40:52,746 --> 00:40:55,429
John, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

290
00:40:55,465 --> 00:40:57,124
Could he already be there?

291
00:40:58,216 --> 00:40:59,526
Are you okay?

292
00:40:59,561 --> 00:41:03,423
<i>- I'm right here. I'm fine.
- Are you sure you're all right?</i>

293
00:41:03,466 --> 00:41:06,663
- What's the dog's name?
- Max.

294
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:09,032
Hey, Janelle.
What's wrong with Wolfie?

295
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:11,586
I can hear him barking.
Is he okay?

296
00:41:11,626 --> 00:41:15,369
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.

297
00:41:15,402 --> 00:41:17,059
Where are you?

298
00:41:18,538 --> 00:41:19,618
Your foster parents are dead.

299
00:41:55,915 --> 00:41:57,857
I need a minute here.

300
00:41:57,899 --> 00:42:02,089
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

301
00:42:02,124 --> 00:42:04,971
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

302
00:42:05,004 --> 00:42:06,433
Get real.

303
00:42:06,476 --> 00:42:10,120
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

304
00:42:10,156 --> 00:42:12,043
No, only an object
of equal size.

305
00:42:12,076 --> 00:42:14,570
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

306
00:42:14,634 --> 00:42:16,575
It can't form complex machines.

307
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,137
Guns and explosives
have chemicals, moving parts.

308
00:42:19,176 --> 00:42:20,518
It doesn't work that way.

309
00:42:20,553 --> 00:42:23,106
- But it can form solid metal shapes.
- Like what?

310
00:42:23,145 --> 00:42:25,185
Knives and stabbing weapons.

311
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,872
These were taken by
a video surveillance camera...

312
00:42:56,906 --> 00:43:00,354
at the West Highland Police Station
in 1984.

313
00:43:01,578 --> 00:43:04,447
He killed 17 police officers
that night.

314
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:07,816
Men with families...

315
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:10,697
children.

316
00:43:12,233 --> 00:43:14,502
These were taken at a mall
in Reseda...

317
00:43:14,538 --> 00:43:16,164
today.

318
00:43:17,802 --> 00:43:21,200
Miss Connor, we know you know
who this guy is.

319
00:43:23,529 --> 00:43:27,807
Look, I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing...

320
00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:30,632
that the foster parents
have been murdered.

321
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:32,292
We know this guy's involved.

322
00:43:33,353 --> 00:43:36,583
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

323
00:43:41,226 --> 00:43:42,655
We're wasting our time.

324
00:43:42,698 --> 00:43:44,770
Let's go.

325
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:47,299
Sorry, guys.

326
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:51,463
She's grown more disconnected
from reality as time goes on.

327
00:43:51,498 --> 00:43:53,702
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

328
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:56,870
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

329
00:43:56,907 --> 00:43:58,434
Sure.

330
00:43:58,475 --> 00:44:01,408
Douglas, take her back to her room.

331
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:02,530
Yes, sir.

332
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:06,081
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

333
00:44:06,123 --> 00:44:08,195
You see...

334
00:44:08,234 --> 00:44:11,334
we spent a lot of time in Nicaragua
and places like that.

335
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:16,714
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy...

336
00:44:16,748 --> 00:44:18,089
running guns.

337
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:20,992
Then there were some other guys.

338
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:22,978
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from...

339
00:44:23,019 --> 00:44:26,118
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

340
00:44:27,818 --> 00:44:29,793
Then she gets busted.

341
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:33,314
It's like, "Sorry, kid, your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?"

342
00:44:35,435 --> 00:44:39,178
Like everything I've been brought up
to believe is all made-up bullshit.

343
00:44:39,211 --> 00:44:41,797
I hated her for that.

344
00:44:44,876 --> 00:44:47,494
But everything she said was true.

345
00:44:48,716 --> 00:44:50,603
She knew...

346
00:44:52,652 --> 00:44:54,691
and nobody believed her...

347
00:44:56,331 --> 00:44:58,218
not even me.

348
00:45:00,043 --> 00:45:01,898
Listen. We gotta get her
out of there.

349
00:45:01,931 --> 00:45:05,160
Negative. The T-1000's highest
probability for success now...

350
00:45:05,196 --> 00:45:08,163
will be to copy Sarah Connor and wait
for you to make contact with her.

351
00:45:08,203 --> 00:45:10,243
Great. What happens to her?

352
00:45:10,283 --> 00:45:13,099
Typically, the subject being copied
is terminated.

353
00:45:13,132 --> 00:45:16,264
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

354
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,340
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

355
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,486
Fuck you!
She's a priority to me!

356
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:26,114
Goddamn it!
What's your problem? Help!

357
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:27,945
This does not help our mission.

358
00:45:27,981 --> 00:45:30,370
Get this psycho off of me!
Help!

359
00:45:30,413 --> 00:45:33,381
I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

360
00:45:33,421 --> 00:45:34,435
Let me go!

361
00:45:38,765 --> 00:45:40,521
Why did you do that?

362
00:45:40,558 --> 00:45:42,412
Because you told me to.

363
00:45:45,101 --> 00:45:46,507
What?

364
00:45:51,309 --> 00:45:53,251
You have to do what I say?

365
00:45:53,293 --> 00:45:55,465
That's one of my mission parameters.

366
00:45:56,621 --> 00:46:00,036
Prove it.
Stand on one foot.

367
00:46:01,996 --> 00:46:03,458
Yes!

368
00:46:05,517 --> 00:46:08,998
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

369
00:46:10,382 --> 00:46:11,659
You okay, kid?

370
00:46:11,695 --> 00:46:13,067
Take a hike, bozo.

371
00:46:13,101 --> 00:46:15,622
Let's get outta here, man.

372
00:46:15,661 --> 00:46:17,483
Fuck you, you little dipshit!

373
00:46:18,189 --> 00:46:19,596
Dipshit?

374
00:46:21,646 --> 00:46:23,718
Put your leg down.

375
00:46:23,757 --> 00:46:28,428
<i>- Did you call moi a dipshit?
- Just trying to help this punk.</i>

376
00:46:28,462 --> 00:46:30,731
Grab this guy.

377
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:33,447
Get him off of me!

378
00:46:33,485 --> 00:46:35,525
Now who's the dipshit...

379
00:46:35,566 --> 00:46:37,289
you jock douche bag?

380
00:46:45,998 --> 00:46:48,387
Put the gun down now!

381
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,561
- Get outta here!
- Come on. Let's split!

382
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,100
You were gonna kill that guy!

383
00:47:00,143 --> 00:47:02,215
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

384
00:47:04,302 --> 00:47:06,887
Listen to me very carefully, okay?

385
00:47:06,926 --> 00:47:10,188
You're not a Terminator anymore,
all right?

386
00:47:10,222 --> 00:47:12,557
You got that?

387
00:47:12,591 --> 00:47:14,827
You just can't go around
killing people.

388
00:47:14,863 --> 00:47:15,845
Why?

389
00:47:16,783 --> 00:47:18,855
What do you mean, why?
'Cause you can't.

390
00:47:19,887 --> 00:47:22,605
Because you just can't.
Trust me on this.

391
00:47:28,368 --> 00:47:31,717
Look. I'm gonna go get my mom.

392
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,508
I order you to help me.

393
00:49:55,987 --> 00:49:58,354
You have a Sarah Connor here?

394
00:49:58,386 --> 00:49:59,980
You're runnin' kind of late.

395
00:50:00,019 --> 00:50:02,408
They've been in there for an hour.

396
00:50:02,451 --> 00:50:04,786
Hold on a second.
I'll buzz you in.

397
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:10,192
Oh, here come your friends now.

398
00:51:09,428 --> 00:51:12,777
- Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

399
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,690
- How 'bout a beer?
- Yeah, right.

400
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:41,712
- Hey, I got a full house.
- That's good, Louis.

401
00:51:41,749 --> 00:51:43,985
Must be my lucky day.

402
00:54:00,886 --> 00:54:03,308
You're right about number 24.

403
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:06,253
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

404
00:54:06,294 --> 00:54:09,076
- Same kind?
- Mm-hmm.

405
00:54:23,191 --> 00:54:25,525
You!

406
00:54:27,927 --> 00:54:29,815
You broke my arm.

407
00:54:29,847 --> 00:54:32,531
There are 215 bones
in the human body.

408
00:54:32,568 --> 00:54:35,089
That's one. Now, don't move.

409
00:54:40,792 --> 00:54:42,384
What are you going to do?

410
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,823
Why do we stop now?

411
00:54:49,015 --> 00:54:52,725
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

412
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,280
- Right.
- Swear?

413
00:54:55,319 --> 00:54:56,781
What?

414
00:54:56,823 --> 00:54:59,824
Just put up your hand and say,
"I swear I won't kill anyone."

415
00:55:00,856 --> 00:55:03,190
I swear I will not kill anyone.

416
00:55:04,183 --> 00:55:06,125
All right. Let's go.

417
00:55:11,479 --> 00:55:13,421
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00...

418
00:55:13,463 --> 00:55:15,667
Monday through Friday.

419
00:55:19,192 --> 00:55:20,403
What the hell are you doing?

420
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,960
You son of a bitch!
You shot me!

421
00:55:24,664 --> 00:55:25,973
Crazy bastard!

422
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:32,243
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

423
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,527
He'll live.

424
00:55:51,385 --> 00:55:53,490
Son of a bitch!

425
00:55:54,874 --> 00:55:56,150
Let's try to remain calm.

426
00:55:56,185 --> 00:55:58,073
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

427
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,112
There's no way, Connor.
Let him go.

428
00:56:00,153 --> 00:56:02,609
- Open the door.
- It ain't gonna happen.

429
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,472
Take it easy, Sarah.

430
00:56:04,506 --> 00:56:07,539
It won't work. You're no killer.
I don't believe you can do it.

431
00:56:07,578 --> 00:56:10,480
You're already dead. Everybody dies.
You know I believe it.

432
00:56:10,522 --> 00:56:12,496
So don't fuck with me!

433
00:56:12,538 --> 00:56:14,196
Open the door!

434
00:56:20,731 --> 00:56:22,355
Back off!

435
00:56:22,394 --> 00:56:23,800
Get back!

436
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:25,720
I'll pump him full of this shit.
I swear!

437
00:56:27,002 --> 00:56:29,009
Don't move!

438
00:56:30,074 --> 00:56:31,251
Drop the shit!

439
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:33,112
Do it!

440
00:56:33,146 --> 00:56:35,033
Get in the office.

441
00:56:35,066 --> 00:56:37,073
On the floor, face down.
Not you!

442
00:56:37,114 --> 00:56:38,772
Open the door.

443
00:56:41,466 --> 00:56:42,873
On the floor. Hold it open.

444
00:56:42,907 --> 00:56:44,794
Face the wall!

445
00:57:00,091 --> 00:57:01,879
Get her!

446
00:57:28,443 --> 00:57:31,313
Hurry up! Open the door!
The door's locked!

447
00:57:32,346 --> 00:57:34,169
Let's go! Open it!

448
00:57:36,508 --> 00:57:38,450
- She broke it off.
- Open it!

449
00:57:43,612 --> 00:57:45,849
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it!

450
00:58:16,668 --> 00:58:17,748
Mom, wait!

451
00:58:24,252 --> 00:58:25,267
Come back here!

452
00:58:29,693 --> 00:58:31,286
- Help her!
- Wait here.

453
00:58:31,325 --> 00:58:33,813
- Hurry up!
- He'll kill us all!

454
00:58:35,036 --> 00:58:36,247
Hold her.

455
00:58:37,725 --> 00:58:38,837
He'll kill us all!

456
00:59:00,126 --> 00:59:02,394
Mom, are you okay? Mom!

457
00:59:06,653 --> 00:59:09,020
Come with me
if you want to live.

458
00:59:09,054 --> 00:59:11,509
It's okay, Mom.
He's here to help.

459
00:59:35,167 --> 00:59:36,214
Go.

460
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:09,654
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

461
01:00:23,775 --> 01:00:25,598
Get down.

462
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,526
Out of the car!

463
01:01:02,848 --> 01:01:03,993
Right now!

464
01:01:27,425 --> 01:01:28,408
Go!

465
01:01:39,202 --> 01:01:40,378
I'm out.

466
01:01:46,913 --> 01:01:48,735
- Come on.
- Here.

467
01:01:51,169 --> 01:01:53,177
Reload.

468
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:03,640
Last one!

469
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:12,056
Hang on.

470
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:38,680
Ready!

471
01:02:51,811 --> 01:02:53,666
Here, drive.

472
01:03:44,708 --> 01:03:46,880
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

473
01:03:46,917 --> 01:03:48,804
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

474
01:03:51,173 --> 01:03:52,252
Can you see anything?

475
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:54,590
I see everything.

476
01:03:57,348 --> 01:03:58,908
Cool.

477
01:04:02,372 --> 01:04:04,259
Come here.

478
01:04:09,733 --> 01:04:11,456
I said I was okay.

479
01:04:12,228 --> 01:04:15,196
John, it was stupid of you
to go there.

480
01:04:16,132 --> 01:04:18,336
You have to be smarter
than that.

481
01:04:18,373 --> 01:04:19,932
You were almost killed.

482
01:04:21,092 --> 01:04:22,751
What were you thinking?

483
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:26,174
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me.

484
01:04:26,213 --> 01:04:27,707
Do you understand?

485
01:04:27,749 --> 01:04:29,243
You're too important.

486
01:04:29,285 --> 01:04:31,838
Do you understand?

487
01:04:34,597 --> 01:04:35,677
But...

488
01:04:37,285 --> 01:04:40,897
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

489
01:04:41,477 --> 01:04:44,063
I didn't need your help.

490
01:04:51,265 --> 01:04:52,792
What's wrong with your eyes?

491
01:04:54,689 --> 01:04:56,096
Nothing.

492
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:07,959
So, what's your story?

493
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:19,129
You okay?

494
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:20,577
Fine.

495
01:05:22,306 --> 01:05:25,470
Say, that's a nice bike.

496
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:48,733
Watch it, lug nuts.

497
01:05:55,907 --> 01:05:59,202
Listen, do you know
what you're doing?

498
01:05:59,235 --> 01:06:01,919
I have detailed files
on human anatomy.

499
01:06:02,819 --> 01:06:04,728
I bet.

500
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:07,672
Makes you a more efficient killer,
right?

501
01:06:07,715 --> 01:06:08,794
Correct.

502
01:06:14,626 --> 01:06:16,514
Does it hurt
when you get shot?

503
01:06:17,539 --> 01:06:20,856
I sense injuries.
The data could be called "pain."

504
01:06:23,108 --> 01:06:24,995
John, help me with the light.

505
01:06:25,028 --> 01:06:27,264
- Will these heal up?
- Yes.

506
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:31,358
Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

507
01:06:31,395 --> 01:06:34,395
How long do you live?
I mean, last. Whatever.

508
01:06:34,435 --> 01:06:37,283
A hundred and twenty years
with my existing power cell.

509
01:06:37,316 --> 01:06:40,163
Can you learn stuff that you
haven't been programmed with...

510
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:41,603
so you can be...

511
01:06:42,757 --> 01:06:45,407
you know, more human...

512
01:06:45,444 --> 01:06:48,095
and not such a dork
all the time?

513
01:06:51,108 --> 01:06:54,524
My CPU is a neural net processor,
a learning computer.

514
01:06:54,565 --> 01:06:58,754
But Skynet presets the switch
to read-only when we're sent out alone.

515
01:07:00,037 --> 01:07:02,403
Doesn't want you to do
too much thinking, huh?

516
01:07:02,436 --> 01:07:03,713
No.

517
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:07,392
Can we reset the switch?

518
01:07:24,676 --> 01:07:28,987
Rotate the two locking cylinders
counterclockwise.

519
01:07:34,598 --> 01:07:36,059
Do it.

520
01:07:43,878 --> 01:07:46,267
Now open the port cover.

521
01:07:48,677 --> 01:07:51,165
<i>Pull to break the seal.</i>

522
01:07:54,116 --> 01:07:57,979
<i>Good, now remove
the shock-damping assembly.</i>

523
01:08:01,349 --> 01:08:03,738
You can now access the CPU.

524
01:08:04,646 --> 01:08:06,784
<i>- Do you see it?
- Yes.</i>

525
01:08:06,822 --> 01:08:10,619
Hold the CPU by its base tab.

526
01:08:10,662 --> 01:08:12,036
<i>Pull.</i>

527
01:08:47,878 --> 01:08:49,569
Do you see the pin switch?

528
01:08:49,607 --> 01:08:51,429
No! No!

529
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:54,912
- Out of my way, John.
- Don't kill him.

530
01:08:54,951 --> 01:08:58,148
<i>lt, John, not him.
It.</i>

531
01:08:58,183 --> 01:09:01,566
<i>Okay, 'It'.
But we need 'It'.</i>

532
01:09:01,608 --> 01:09:04,161
Listen to me.
You listen.

533
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:06,272
We're better-off on our own.

534
01:09:06,312 --> 01:09:08,101
But he's the only proof we have...

535
01:09:08,135 --> 01:09:10,556
of the future and the war
and all that.

536
01:09:10,599 --> 01:09:11,973
Maybe.

537
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,447
I don't trust it.

538
01:09:16,487 --> 01:09:18,113
But he's my friend, all right?

539
01:09:18,919 --> 01:09:21,636
You don't know what it's like
to try to kill one of these things...

540
01:09:21,672 --> 01:09:25,120
and if something goes wrong
this could be our last chance, so move!

541
01:09:25,159 --> 01:09:27,199
If I'm ever supposed to be this
great military leader...

542
01:09:27,239 --> 01:09:30,949
maybe you should start listening
to my leadership ideas once in a while.

543
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,523
Because if my own mother won't...

544
01:09:35,561 --> 01:09:38,276
how do you expect anyone else to?

545
01:09:51,881 --> 01:09:54,847
All right, play it your way.

546
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,968
Was there a problem?

547
01:10:04,009 --> 01:10:05,471
No problem.

548
01:10:07,081 --> 01:10:08,292
None whatsoever.

549
01:10:40,545 --> 01:10:42,432
Are we learning yet?

550
01:10:54,338 --> 01:10:57,184
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

551
01:11:00,736 --> 01:11:02,297
Just head south.

552
01:11:10,688 --> 01:11:12,249
Keep it under 65.

553
01:11:12,288 --> 01:11:15,136
- We don't want to be pulled over.
- Affirmative.

554
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:20,664
You gotta listen to the way
people talk.

555
01:11:20,706 --> 01:11:24,120
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

556
01:11:24,161 --> 01:11:26,364
<i>You say, ''No problemo''.</i>

557
01:11:26,401 --> 01:11:30,198
If someone comes off to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me."

558
01:11:30,241 --> 01:11:34,365
<i>And if you want to shine them on,
it's ''Hasta la vista, baby.''</i>

559
01:11:34,913 --> 01:11:37,019
<i>Hasta la vista, baby.</i>

560
01:11:37,538 --> 01:11:39,512
Yeah, or ''Later, dick-wad''.

561
01:11:39,554 --> 01:11:42,489
If someone gets upset,
you say, ''Chill out''.

562
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:43,936
Or you can do combinations.

563
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:46,847
Chill out, dick-wad.

564
01:11:47,617 --> 01:11:49,559
That's great.
See? You're getting it.

565
01:11:49,666 --> 01:11:50,648
<i>No problemo.</i>

566
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:03,103
You got any cash?

567
01:12:03,136 --> 01:12:06,584
I got a couple hundred bucks.
I'll give you half.

568
01:12:06,624 --> 01:12:08,249
Mom!

569
01:12:09,344 --> 01:12:11,286
Get some food.

570
01:12:13,184 --> 01:12:15,604
No sense of humor.

571
01:12:20,543 --> 01:12:24,155
That's another thing.
You can lighten up a bit yourself.

572
01:12:25,024 --> 01:12:27,130
This severe routine
is getting old, okay.

573
01:12:27,168 --> 01:12:28,990
I mean, you're acting
like such a geek.

574
01:12:29,025 --> 01:12:30,967
Smile once in a while.

575
01:12:31,008 --> 01:12:32,349
Smile?

576
01:12:32,384 --> 01:12:36,182
Yeah, you know, smile.
Watch.

577
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:40,698
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?

578
01:12:41,567 --> 01:12:43,389
Give me a break.

579
01:12:44,224 --> 01:12:46,166
Okay, bad example.

580
01:12:47,232 --> 01:12:48,857
See that guy over there?

581
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,750
That's a smile.

582
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,709
That's good.

583
01:13:10,752 --> 01:13:14,429
Maybe you could practice
in front of a mirror or something.

584
01:13:20,545 --> 01:13:22,433
Want some of my fries?

585
01:13:32,001 --> 01:13:33,889
Need any help?

586
01:13:33,921 --> 01:13:35,547
No.

587
01:13:35,586 --> 01:13:37,374
- I got you!
- No, you didn't!

588
01:13:45,378 --> 01:13:48,412
We're not gonna make it,
are we?

589
01:13:50,211 --> 01:13:51,421
People, I mean.

590
01:13:54,083 --> 01:13:56,221
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

591
01:13:57,218 --> 01:14:00,066
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

592
01:14:01,153 --> 01:14:02,495
Break it up before I wring
both of your necks.

593
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:07,928
I need to know
how Skynet gets built.

594
01:14:07,968 --> 01:14:09,212
Who's responsible?

595
01:14:09,248 --> 01:14:12,697
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

596
01:14:12,736 --> 01:14:14,427
Who is that?

597
01:14:14,464 --> 01:14:18,261
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

598
01:14:20,896 --> 01:14:22,620
Why him?

599
01:14:22,656 --> 01:14:25,918
In a few months he creates
a revolutionary type of microprocessor.

600
01:14:26,911 --> 01:14:28,221
Go on. Then what?

601
01:14:29,249 --> 01:14:32,096
In three years, Cyberdyne will become
the largest supplier...

602
01:14:32,128 --> 01:14:33,503
of military computer systems.

603
01:14:34,496 --> 01:14:37,344
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers...

604
01:14:37,376 --> 01:14:38,806
becoming fully unmanned.

605
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:41,816
Afterwards they fly with
a perfect operational record.

606
01:14:41,856 --> 01:14:44,442
The Skynet funding bill is passed.

607
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:47,645
The system goes on-line
on August 4, 1997.

608
01:14:47,681 --> 01:14:50,779
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defense.

609
01:14:50,817 --> 01:14:53,467
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

610
01:14:53,505 --> 01:14:57,661
It becomes self-aware
at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29.

611
01:14:58,657 --> 01:15:01,177
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

612
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:04,413
- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.

613
01:15:04,449 --> 01:15:07,132
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

614
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:10,136
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

615
01:15:10,178 --> 01:15:12,512
Because Skynet knows
that the Russian counterattack...

616
01:15:12,545 --> 01:15:14,433
will eliminate its enemies
over here.

617
01:15:14,465 --> 01:15:16,353
Jesus.

618
01:15:18,561 --> 01:15:20,449
How much do you know
about Dyson?

619
01:15:22,465 --> 01:15:24,352
I have detailed files.

620
01:15:25,474 --> 01:15:27,361
I want to know everything.

621
01:15:27,586 --> 01:15:29,855
What he looks like,
where he lives, everything.

622
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:44,990
Miles.

623
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:49,172
<i>Miles.</i>

624
01:16:06,302 --> 01:16:08,026
Are you going to work all day?

625
01:16:08,062 --> 01:16:11,805
I'm sorry, baby.
But this thing is just kicking my ass.

626
01:16:11,838 --> 01:16:13,147
Miles, it's Sunday.

627
01:16:13,182 --> 01:16:15,833
You promised to take the kids
to Raging Waters today.

628
01:16:17,342 --> 01:16:18,804
I can't...

629
01:16:19,422 --> 01:16:21,047
I'm on a roll.

630
01:16:33,343 --> 01:16:35,547
Baby, this is going
to blow them all away.

631
01:16:35,583 --> 01:16:38,583
- It's a neural net processor.
- I know. You told me.

632
01:16:38,623 --> 01:16:41,688
It's a neural net processor.
It thinks and learns like we do.

633
01:16:41,726 --> 01:16:44,345
It's superconducting
at room temperature.

634
01:16:44,382 --> 01:16:48,474
Other computers are just
pocket calculators by comparison.

635
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:52,506
But why is that
so goddamn important, Miles?

636
01:16:52,543 --> 01:16:53,852
I really need to know...

637
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:56,886
because sometimes I feel
like I'm going crazy here.

638
01:16:58,463 --> 01:17:00,405
Baby, I am this close.

639
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:02,421
Come here.

640
01:17:04,928 --> 01:17:07,383
Imagine a jet airliner...

641
01:17:07,423 --> 01:17:10,008
with a pilot that never gets tired,
never makes mistakes...

642
01:17:10,047 --> 01:17:11,869
never shows up to work
with a hangover.

643
01:17:14,144 --> 01:17:16,511
Meet the pilot.

644
01:17:16,544 --> 01:17:19,545
Why did we get married, Miles?
Why did we have these children?

645
01:17:19,585 --> 01:17:20,599
You don't need us.

646
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,990
Your heart and your mind
are in here.

647
01:17:24,033 --> 01:17:26,815
But it doesn't love you
like we do.

648
01:17:34,624 --> 01:17:37,144
I'm sorry.
Really.

649
01:17:37,184 --> 01:17:41,307
How about spending some time
with your other babies?

650
01:17:43,841 --> 01:17:45,630
<i>Raging Waters!</i>

651
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:15,290
Wait in the car.

652
01:18:52,576 --> 01:18:54,234
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

653
01:19:14,274 --> 01:19:15,833
Hey, big John.

654
01:19:16,546 --> 01:19:17,560
What's up?

655
01:19:18,912 --> 01:19:19,993
He's cool, Enrique.

656
01:19:20,033 --> 01:19:21,112
He's with me.

657
01:19:21,153 --> 01:19:24,219
He's... Uncle Bob.

658
01:19:24,256 --> 01:19:26,296
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

659
01:19:26,337 --> 01:19:28,191
Uncle Bob, huh?

660
01:19:29,186 --> 01:19:30,429
Okay.

661
01:19:37,121 --> 01:19:38,102
Drink?

662
01:19:43,105 --> 01:19:44,479
"Uncle Bob"?

663
01:19:46,401 --> 01:19:49,248
You're pretty famous,
all over the goddamn TV.

664
01:19:49,281 --> 01:19:51,867
Pictures of you, John,
your big friend here.

665
01:19:51,905 --> 01:19:54,752
Cops are going nuts
looking for you.

666
01:19:57,441 --> 01:20:01,402
I just came for my stuff.
I need clothes, food and a truck.

667
01:20:01,441 --> 01:20:03,329
How about the fillings in my teeth?

668
01:20:03,361 --> 01:20:05,466
Now, Enrique.

669
01:20:06,722 --> 01:20:08,861
You two,
you're on weapons detail.

670
01:20:08,898 --> 01:20:10,175
Let's go.

671
01:20:30,275 --> 01:20:32,162
One thing about my mom--

672
01:20:34,338 --> 01:20:36,226
she always plans ahead.

673
01:20:46,656 --> 01:20:46,972
Excellent.

674
01:20:57,823 --> 01:21:01,368
This is my best truck,
but the starter motor's gone.

675
01:21:01,406 --> 01:21:03,294
You got time to change it out?

676
01:21:03,327 --> 01:21:06,587
Yeah. I'm gonna wait 'til dark
to cross the border.

677
01:21:06,622 --> 01:21:08,084
Enrique.

678
01:21:08,126 --> 01:21:11,574
It's dangerous for you here.
You get out tonight too, okay?

679
01:21:11,614 --> 01:21:14,102
Sure.

680
01:21:14,142 --> 01:21:17,720
Just drop by anytime
and totally fuck up my life, all right?

681
01:21:21,951 --> 01:21:25,365
See, I grew up in places like this...

682
01:21:25,406 --> 01:21:27,774
so I just thought
that's how people lived--

683
01:21:28,991 --> 01:21:31,641
riding around in helicopters...

684
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:34,810
Iearning how to blow shit up.

685
01:21:36,222 --> 01:21:38,808
But then when my mom got busted...

686
01:21:38,847 --> 01:21:41,148
I got put into a regular school.

687
01:21:41,758 --> 01:21:44,442
All the other kids
were into Nintendo.

688
01:21:58,078 --> 01:22:00,183
Are you ever afraid?

689
01:22:00,222 --> 01:22:02,327
No.

690
01:22:05,183 --> 01:22:06,809
Not even of dying?

691
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:09,211
No.

692
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:17,563
You don't feel any emotion about it,
one way or another?

693
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,429
No. I have to stay functional
until my mission is complete.

694
01:22:26,208 --> 01:22:29,242
Then it doesn't matter.

695
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:32,761
I have to stay functional too.
"I'm too important."

696
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:50,138
That's definitely you.

697
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:03,359
Most of the guys my mom
hung around with were geeks...

698
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:07,350
but there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

699
01:23:07,389 --> 01:23:09,277
He taught me engines.

700
01:23:09,309 --> 01:23:11,448
Hold here.

701
01:23:11,485 --> 01:23:13,819
Mom screwed it up, of course.

702
01:23:13,853 --> 01:23:16,241
She'd always tell 'em
about Judgment Day...

703
01:23:16,284 --> 01:23:19,001
and me being this world leader.

704
01:23:19,037 --> 01:23:20,924
That'd be all she wrote.

705
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:23,284
Torque wrench, please.

706
01:23:25,437 --> 01:23:26,647
Here.

707
01:23:26,685 --> 01:23:29,784
I wish I could've met
my real dad.

708
01:23:29,821 --> 01:23:31,545
You will.

709
01:23:31,582 --> 01:23:33,721
Yeah, I guess.

710
01:23:33,757 --> 01:23:37,467
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

711
01:23:37,501 --> 01:23:41,113
They sent him back through time
to 1984.

712
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:42,556
Man.

713
01:23:43,997 --> 01:23:46,365
He hasn't even been born yet.

714
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:49,949
It messes with your head.

715
01:23:52,542 --> 01:23:55,389
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.

716
01:24:01,438 --> 01:24:04,886
Mom and him were only together
for one night.

717
01:24:04,927 --> 01:24:07,316
She still loves him, I guess.

718
01:24:07,358 --> 01:24:10,172
I see her crying sometimes.

719
01:24:10,206 --> 01:24:14,484
She denies it totally, of course,
like she got something stuck in her eye.

720
01:24:18,782 --> 01:24:20,277
Why do you cry?

721
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:22,772
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

722
01:24:22,815 --> 01:24:24,190
I don't know.

723
01:24:24,223 --> 01:24:26,263
We just cry...

724
01:24:26,303 --> 01:24:28,791
you know, when it hurts.

725
01:24:34,592 --> 01:24:36,315
Pain causes it?

726
01:24:37,311 --> 01:24:39,383
No. It's different.

727
01:24:39,423 --> 01:24:42,620
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyway.

728
01:24:42,655 --> 01:24:44,216
- You get it?
- No.

729
01:24:45,406 --> 01:24:47,097
All right, my man!

730
01:24:47,647 --> 01:24:48,629
<i>No problemo.</i>

731
01:24:48,799 --> 01:24:50,359
Give me five.

732
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,359
Just put out your hand
like this.

733
01:24:55,648 --> 01:24:59,804
All right! Now hit me.
Give me five. Do the same thing.

734
01:25:04,319 --> 01:25:06,708
Okay, that's good.
Up high.

735
01:25:07,615 --> 01:25:08,892
Five low.

736
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:10,582
Too slow.

737
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:15,611
I'm just kidding.
One more time.

738
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:17,819
Good. Now try it.

739
01:25:17,856 --> 01:25:19,743
Now do me.
Give me five.

740
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:25,528
<i>Watching John with the machine,
it was suddenly so clear.</i>

741
01:25:25,568 --> 01:25:28,415
<i>The Terminator would never stop.</i>

742
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:32,278
<i>lt would never leave him,
never hurt him...</i>

743
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:35,636
<i>never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him...</i>

744
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:38,167
<i>or be too busy
to spend time with him.</i>

745
01:25:38,975 --> 01:25:41,049
<i>lt would always be there...</i>

746
01:25:41,088 --> 01:25:43,673
<i>and it would die
to protect him.</i>

747
01:25:44,992 --> 01:25:48,253
<i>Of all the would-be fathers
who came and went over the years...</i>

748
01:25:48,288 --> 01:25:50,264
<i>this thing, this machine...</i>

749
01:25:50,305 --> 01:25:52,606
<i>was the only one
who measured up.</i>

750
01:25:53,313 --> 01:25:55,135
<i>ln an insane world...</i>

751
01:25:55,169 --> 01:25:57,056
<i>it was the sanest choice.</i>

752
01:27:30,819 --> 01:27:32,707
Hey, let's try this one.

753
01:27:38,083 --> 01:27:40,222
There we go.

754
01:29:21,926 --> 01:29:24,347
She said go south with him
like you planned.

755
01:29:24,389 --> 01:29:26,528
- She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!

756
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:29,375
Mom, wait!

757
01:29:44,007 --> 01:29:45,414
"No fate."

758
01:29:46,566 --> 01:29:48,933
No fate but what we make.

759
01:29:50,951 --> 01:29:52,838
My father told her this.

760
01:29:55,335 --> 01:29:59,458
I made him memorize it in the future
as a message to her.

761
01:30:01,031 --> 01:30:02,918
Never mind.

762
01:30:02,951 --> 01:30:06,213
Okay, the whole thing goes--

763
01:30:06,247 --> 01:30:08,865
The future's not set.

764
01:30:08,903 --> 01:30:12,318
There's no fate but what
we make for ourselves.

765
01:30:12,359 --> 01:30:15,294
She intends to change the future.

766
01:30:15,336 --> 01:30:16,742
Yeah, I guess.

767
01:30:18,215 --> 01:30:20,003
Oh, shit!

768
01:30:20,039 --> 01:30:21,926
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

769
01:30:21,959 --> 01:30:25,341
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

770
01:30:25,383 --> 01:30:27,357
She's gonna blow him away.

771
01:30:27,399 --> 01:30:29,373
Come on! Let's go!

772
01:30:41,288 --> 01:30:43,262
This is tactically dangerous.

773
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:44,383
Drive faster.

774
01:30:44,423 --> 01:30:46,911
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do.

775
01:30:46,951 --> 01:30:50,268
It knows what I know.
It might anticipate this move.

776
01:30:50,312 --> 01:30:52,701
I don't care.
We gotta stop her.

777
01:30:52,743 --> 01:30:54,630
Killing Dyson
might prevent the war.

778
01:30:54,663 --> 01:30:56,452
I don't care!

779
01:30:57,029 --> 01:30:58,752
Haven't you learned anything yet?

780
01:30:58,789 --> 01:31:01,210
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

781
01:31:03,781 --> 01:31:06,269
Look, maybe you don't care
if you live or die...

782
01:31:06,309 --> 01:31:08,414
but everybody's not like that.

783
01:31:08,453 --> 01:31:11,901
We have feelings.
We hurt. We're afraid.

784
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:17,855
You got to learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.

785
01:31:53,831 --> 01:31:57,028
Danny, I told you to go to bed,
like your sister.

786
01:31:57,063 --> 01:31:59,267
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!

787
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:17,541
Danny, your time is up!

788
01:32:17,575 --> 01:32:20,422
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

789
01:32:47,782 --> 01:32:49,342
Danny!

790
01:33:00,454 --> 01:33:01,796
Daddy!

791
01:33:01,830 --> 01:33:04,219
Danny, go! Go!

792
01:33:05,703 --> 01:33:06,880
Miles?

793
01:33:11,879 --> 01:33:14,246
- Tarissa, run!
- Oh, my God!

794
01:33:20,999 --> 01:33:22,974
Just take Danny and run!

795
01:33:23,015 --> 01:33:24,259
Run!

796
01:33:24,295 --> 01:33:26,018
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

797
01:33:44,103 --> 01:33:45,118
Daddy!

798
01:33:46,696 --> 01:33:48,158
Nobody fucking move!

799
01:33:48,903 --> 01:33:50,148
Don't hurt my daddy!

800
01:33:50,184 --> 01:33:51,710
On the floor, bitch.

801
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:53,856
Get down now!

802
01:33:54,663 --> 01:33:55,743
Get out of the way!

803
01:33:55,783 --> 01:33:57,190
Don't hurt him!

804
01:33:58,599 --> 01:34:00,573
Get on the floor now!

805
01:34:03,464 --> 01:34:05,154
Just let the boy go.

806
01:34:05,191 --> 01:34:06,752
Shut up. Shut up.

807
01:34:06,792 --> 01:34:08,068
Shut up!

808
01:34:08,103 --> 01:34:10,624
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

809
01:34:10,664 --> 01:34:12,867
- It's all your fault!
- What?

810
01:34:12,904 --> 01:34:14,944
I'm not gonna let you do it.

811
01:35:04,810 --> 01:35:06,882
Shit! We're too late!

812
01:35:11,144 --> 01:35:12,224
Check them.

813
01:35:15,753 --> 01:35:17,695
Look at me, Mom.

814
01:35:17,737 --> 01:35:19,876
Are you hurt?

815
01:35:23,337 --> 01:35:25,345
I almost--

816
01:35:36,490 --> 01:35:38,791
It'll be okay.

817
01:35:38,824 --> 01:35:40,712
We'll figure something out.
Okay?

818
01:35:42,217 --> 01:35:43,843
I promise.

819
01:35:46,953 --> 01:35:49,800
You came here to stop me.

820
01:35:50,634 --> 01:35:52,522
Yeah, I did.

821
01:35:55,274 --> 01:35:57,183
I love you, John.

822
01:35:58,794 --> 01:36:00,321
I always have.

823
01:36:02,122 --> 01:36:03,529
I know.

824
01:36:10,217 --> 01:36:12,357
Deep penetration.

825
01:36:13,866 --> 01:36:15,753
No shattered bone.

826
01:36:15,786 --> 01:36:18,634
Hold here.
The pressure should stop the bleeding.

827
01:36:28,940 --> 01:36:30,313
Who are you people?

828
01:36:31,211 --> 01:36:32,619
Show him.

829
01:36:35,147 --> 01:36:39,206
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

830
01:37:17,964 --> 01:37:19,208
Oh, my God.

831
01:37:19,245 --> 01:37:21,797
Now listen to me
very carefully.

832
01:37:27,436 --> 01:37:31,429
<i>Dyson listened while the Terminator
laid it all down.</i>

833
01:37:31,468 --> 01:37:35,210
<i>Skynet. Judgment Day.</i>

834
01:37:35,244 --> 01:37:37,481
<i>The history of things to come.</i>

835
01:37:38,828 --> 01:37:41,512
<i>lt's not every day that
you find out you're responsible...</i>

836
01:37:41,549 --> 01:37:44,298
<i>for three billion deaths.</i>

837
01:37:44,332 --> 01:37:46,219
<i>He took it pretty well.</i>

838
01:37:48,109 --> 01:37:50,476
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

839
01:37:56,237 --> 01:37:58,309
You're judging me...

840
01:37:58,349 --> 01:38:00,715
on things I haven't even done yet.

841
01:38:04,748 --> 01:38:06,788
How were we supposed to know?

842
01:38:09,134 --> 01:38:11,043
Yeah.

843
01:38:11,085 --> 01:38:13,420
Right.

844
01:38:13,453 --> 01:38:15,526
How were you supposed to know?

845
01:38:16,525 --> 01:38:18,314
Fucking men like you...

846
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:20,106
built the hydrogen bomb.

847
01:38:20,142 --> 01:38:22,662
Men like you...

848
01:38:22,702 --> 01:38:24,109
thought it up.

849
01:38:27,790 --> 01:38:29,677
You think you're so creative.

850
01:38:31,021 --> 01:38:34,022
You don't know what it's like
to really create something...

851
01:38:34,062 --> 01:38:36,167
to create a life...

852
01:38:36,206 --> 01:38:37,701
to feel it growing inside you.

853
01:38:37,742 --> 01:38:40,590
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

854
01:38:40,623 --> 01:38:42,281
Mom!

855
01:38:42,319 --> 01:38:45,963
We need to be a little more
constructive here. Okay?

856
01:38:45,998 --> 01:38:48,038
We still have to stop this
from happening.

857
01:38:48,078 --> 01:38:50,828
But I thought--

858
01:38:50,862 --> 01:38:54,724
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

859
01:38:54,766 --> 01:38:59,436
That's right. There's no way I'm going
to finish the new processor. Not now.

860
01:38:59,470 --> 01:39:02,820
Forget it. I'm out of it.
I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.

861
01:39:02,863 --> 01:39:04,718
That's not good enough.

862
01:39:04,751 --> 01:39:06,639
No one must follow your work.

863
01:39:06,671 --> 01:39:08,494
Right.

864
01:39:08,527 --> 01:39:12,749
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab--

865
01:39:12,782 --> 01:39:14,343
the files, the disk drives...

866
01:39:14,382 --> 01:39:16,968
everything here.

867
01:39:17,006 --> 01:39:19,013
Everything.

868
01:39:19,054 --> 01:39:20,942
I don't care.

869
01:39:22,127 --> 01:39:23,142
The chip.

870
01:39:23,183 --> 01:39:25,223
- Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

871
01:39:25,263 --> 01:39:27,630
It's at Cyberdyne.
It's from the other one like you.

872
01:39:27,663 --> 01:39:30,313
The CPU from the first Terminator.

873
01:39:30,351 --> 01:39:32,686
Son of a bitch!
I knew it!

874
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:35,369
They told us not to ask
where they got it.

875
01:39:35,406 --> 01:39:37,675
Those lying motherfuckers.

876
01:39:37,710 --> 01:39:39,467
It's scary stuff.
Radically advanced.

877
01:39:39,502 --> 01:39:40,648
It was smashed.

878
01:39:40,687 --> 01:39:44,200
It didn't work, but it gave us ideas,
took us in new directions.

879
01:39:44,239 --> 01:39:46,181
Things we would've never--

880
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:50,279
All my work was based on it.

881
01:39:50,319 --> 01:39:52,075
It must be destroyed.

882
01:39:54,223 --> 01:39:57,158
Can you get us in?
Past security?

883
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:59,207
I think so, yeah. When?

884
01:40:03,888 --> 01:40:04,967
Now?

885
01:40:08,624 --> 01:40:11,592
<i>The future,
always so clear to me...</i>

886
01:40:11,632 --> 01:40:14,534
<i>had become like
a black highway at night.</i>

887
01:40:14,576 --> 01:40:17,228
<i>We were in
uncharted territory now...</i>

888
01:40:17,265 --> 01:40:20,112
<i>making up history
as we went along.</i>

889
01:40:56,816 --> 01:40:58,704
Carl, right?

890
01:40:59,953 --> 01:41:03,270
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd...

891
01:41:03,313 --> 01:41:05,288
take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.

892
01:41:05,329 --> 01:41:08,526
Mr. Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

893
01:41:08,561 --> 01:41:10,634
I need written authorization--

894
01:41:11,633 --> 01:41:13,608
I insist.

895
01:41:13,649 --> 01:41:15,373
Don't even think about it.

896
01:41:25,841 --> 01:41:27,248
It's okay.

897
01:41:28,593 --> 01:41:31,627
It takes two keys, turned
simultaneously, to open the vault.

898
01:41:31,665 --> 01:41:34,513
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

899
01:41:35,761 --> 01:41:37,168
Gibbons?

900
01:41:40,083 --> 01:41:41,871
Gibbons! Come on, man!

901
01:41:41,907 --> 01:41:44,906
You can't leave the desk
like that!

902
01:41:49,523 --> 01:41:50,951
Oh, shit.

903
01:42:07,796 --> 01:42:09,770
My card should access this.

904
01:42:14,195 --> 01:42:16,562
- What is it?
- Damn it.

905
01:42:16,594 --> 01:42:18,504
The silent alarm's been tripped.

906
01:42:24,403 --> 01:42:27,054
It's neutralized all the codes
in the entire building.

907
01:42:27,091 --> 01:42:28,978
Nothing will open anywhere now.

908
01:42:29,972 --> 01:42:31,794
We have to abort.

909
01:42:34,835 --> 01:42:38,131
We go all the way.
Okay?

910
01:42:40,148 --> 01:42:43,857
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

911
01:42:43,891 --> 01:42:46,258
- I think it's that guy from the mall.
- It is.

912
01:42:46,291 --> 01:42:48,178
It's him and the woman.

913
01:42:49,651 --> 01:42:52,751
Just send everything
you got in the area right now.

914
01:42:54,836 --> 01:42:58,152
I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

915
01:43:02,452 --> 01:43:03,532
It's no good.

916
01:43:03,572 --> 01:43:05,033
Let me try mine.

917
01:43:09,812 --> 01:43:11,852
John, fire in the hole!

918
01:43:23,348 --> 01:43:28,018
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the Halon system.

919
01:43:34,838 --> 01:43:36,755
You have to wait
until the gas clears.

920
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:40,844
Put this on.

921
01:43:54,224 --> 01:43:56,679
All right, let's get to work.

922
01:44:16,944 --> 01:44:20,141
<i>All units in the vicinity
and all units able to respond...</i>

923
01:44:20,176 --> 01:44:24,847
<i>a 211 in progress, 2144 Kramer Street,
the Cyberdyne building.</i>

924
01:44:24,881 --> 01:44:26,505
<i>Suspect one is white female...</i>

925
01:44:26,544 --> 01:44:29,893
<i>identified as last name Connor,
first name Sarah.</i>

926
01:44:29,936 --> 01:44:32,784
<i>Escaped last night
from Pescadero State Hospital.</i>

927
01:44:32,816 --> 01:44:34,704
<i>Suspect two: White male...</i>

928
01:44:38,193 --> 01:44:40,298
All the disks in my office...

929
01:44:40,336 --> 01:44:42,441
all the disks
in that office over there...

930
01:44:42,481 --> 01:44:44,423
everything behind my desk...

931
01:44:44,465 --> 01:44:46,669
and all the processors
on my left.

932
01:44:46,704 --> 01:44:49,193
We'll blow those with the CP4.

933
01:45:02,225 --> 01:45:03,654
Can l...

934
01:45:04,273 --> 01:45:05,997
Excuse me.

935
01:45:07,602 --> 01:45:10,122
Can I borrow that thing?

936
01:45:18,834 --> 01:45:21,103
I worked a lot of years on this thing.

937
01:45:24,946 --> 01:45:27,085
<i>One-Mary-23,
give me that location again.</i>

938
01:45:27,122 --> 01:45:28,846
<i>2111 Kramer.</i>

939
01:45:28,882 --> 01:45:31,752
<i>Suspects are armed and
considered extremely dangerous.</i>

940
01:46:21,966 --> 01:46:23,625
All right.

941
01:46:23,663 --> 01:46:25,387
7-2-5-6.

942
01:46:32,079 --> 01:46:33,388
Easy money.

943
01:46:37,935 --> 01:46:39,341
Uh-oh.

944
01:46:41,935 --> 01:46:44,302
Oh, shit. Not good.

945
01:46:49,135 --> 01:46:50,727
How we doing?

946
01:46:50,766 --> 01:46:52,425
Primer cord is set.

947
01:46:52,463 --> 01:46:54,831
One more barrel,
two more minutes.

948
01:46:58,543 --> 01:47:01,390
- How do we set them off?
- Remote control.

949
01:47:01,423 --> 01:47:03,757
Piece of cake.

950
01:47:03,791 --> 01:47:05,285
- We got company.
- Police?

951
01:47:05,327 --> 01:47:08,590
- How many?
- All of 'em, I think.

952
01:47:08,624 --> 01:47:09,966
Go. I'll finish here.

953
01:47:11,856 --> 01:47:13,264
Come on.

954
01:47:14,256 --> 01:47:16,143
I'll take care of the police.

955
01:47:16,176 --> 01:47:17,453
Wait! You swore!

956
01:47:20,272 --> 01:47:21,679
Trust me.

957
01:47:34,384 --> 01:47:35,977
<i>You at the window!</i>

958
01:47:36,017 --> 01:47:39,366
<i>Drop your weapon and place
your hands on top of your head!</i>

959
01:47:40,624 --> 01:47:42,412
Holy shit!

960
01:47:42,448 --> 01:47:43,942
That's a mini-gun!

961
01:48:05,265 --> 01:48:07,534
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!

962
01:48:07,569 --> 01:48:09,096
Go! Go! Go!

963
01:48:54,706 --> 01:48:56,113
Fire!

964
01:49:12,723 --> 01:49:14,349
Same time, to the left.

965
01:49:14,388 --> 01:49:16,657
One, two, three, go.

966
01:49:28,276 --> 01:49:31,025
In order to get that out--

967
01:49:37,492 --> 01:49:40,176
We got Skynet by the balls now.

968
01:49:40,212 --> 01:49:41,788
Come on, let's book.

969
01:49:42,962 --> 01:49:44,456
Hold your fire!

970
01:50:08,819 --> 01:50:10,793
- Ready to rock?
- Ready.

971
01:50:14,258 --> 01:50:15,535
Time to go.

972
01:50:15,571 --> 01:50:17,000
Now.

973
01:50:17,043 --> 01:50:19,912
- Take this. They'll use gas.
- Come on.

974
01:50:19,954 --> 01:50:22,955
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

975
01:50:46,197 --> 01:50:48,880
Mom! Mom!

976
01:51:31,413 --> 01:51:32,493
Shit!

977
01:51:33,845 --> 01:51:36,693
She's in the clean room.
There's no way outta there.

978
01:51:45,814 --> 01:51:46,795
Get down!

979
01:51:53,910 --> 01:51:55,317
Here.

980
01:52:19,766 --> 01:52:23,083
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

981
01:52:27,063 --> 01:52:28,525
Fall back!

982
01:52:28,567 --> 01:52:30,127
Everybody out!

983
01:52:30,167 --> 01:52:32,022
Fall back now!
Go! Go! Go!

984
01:53:05,975 --> 01:53:07,862
<i>We got a war zone here!</i>

985
01:53:38,457 --> 01:53:40,115
Shut your eyes.

986
01:53:46,424 --> 01:53:49,490
Stay here. I'll be back.

987
01:53:56,952 --> 01:53:59,221
Get down on the floor!
Face down!

988
01:54:01,816 --> 01:54:03,310
On the floor now!

989
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:07,022
Okay, drop him!

990
01:55:23,610 --> 01:55:25,017
Here, hold this.

991
01:55:41,083 --> 01:55:42,644
Holy shit!

992
01:55:57,084 --> 01:55:58,065
Go!

993
01:56:35,324 --> 01:56:36,307
Shit!

994
01:56:49,245 --> 01:56:50,870
Get out.

995
01:57:09,116 --> 01:57:10,426
Listen.

996
01:57:10,461 --> 01:57:13,080
No matter what happens,
stay under these vests.

997
01:57:13,118 --> 01:57:14,392
- You got it?
- Yeah.

998
01:57:14,428 --> 01:57:15,835
All right.

999
01:57:29,758 --> 01:57:31,001
Chopper's coming in!

1000
01:57:31,036 --> 01:57:32,117
It's him.

1001
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:28,862
Shit!

1002
01:58:31,583 --> 01:58:33,339
Stay down!

1003
01:59:44,545 --> 01:59:46,268
Goddamn!

1004
01:59:46,305 --> 01:59:47,287
You okay--

1005
01:59:54,081 --> 01:59:56,447
Come on, Mom,
we gotta get out.

1006
01:59:58,241 --> 01:59:59,834
Take the shotgun.

1007
02:00:03,458 --> 02:00:04,439
Are you hurt?

1008
02:00:17,090 --> 02:00:18,072
Holy shit.

1009
02:00:18,114 --> 02:00:19,936
Come on, Mom. Come on!

1010
02:00:19,969 --> 02:00:21,081
We need your truck.

1011
02:00:21,121 --> 02:00:22,582
Hurry!

1012
02:00:27,362 --> 02:00:29,817
- Come on. Hurry.
- Get in.

1013
02:00:32,641 --> 02:00:33,852
Go!

1014
02:00:39,586 --> 02:00:41,528
What the hell--

1015
02:00:47,137 --> 02:00:49,821
- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

1016
02:00:51,394 --> 02:00:52,986
Here. This'll work.

1017
02:00:58,338 --> 02:00:59,964
He's gaining.

1018
02:01:02,401 --> 02:01:04,060
Step on it!

1019
02:01:04,098 --> 02:01:06,816
- This is the vehicle's top speed.
- I can run faster than this!

1020
02:01:17,187 --> 02:01:18,594
Coming up, to the right.

1021
02:01:20,547 --> 02:01:22,434
Watch it! Watch it!

1022
02:01:44,068 --> 02:01:46,108
- Drive.
- Where are you going?

1023
02:01:53,252 --> 02:01:55,139
Take the off-ramp.

1024
02:02:04,389 --> 02:02:05,533
Shit!

1025
02:02:08,547 --> 02:02:09,562
Hold on!

1026
02:02:53,542 --> 02:02:55,134
Don't stop!

1027
02:03:02,629 --> 02:03:03,971
Go straight!

1028
02:03:06,502 --> 02:03:07,483
Look out!

1029
02:03:07,526 --> 02:03:08,508
Duck!

1030
02:03:22,247 --> 02:03:24,134
Get the hell outta here!

1031
02:03:29,414 --> 02:03:32,381
Get outta here!
Let's go! Come on!

1032
02:04:46,183 --> 02:04:48,573
<i>Hasta la vista, baby.</i>

1033
02:05:36,041 --> 02:05:37,448
We don't have much time.

1034
02:05:59,145 --> 02:06:00,389
Let's go.

1035
02:06:01,386 --> 02:06:03,077
We gotta get outta here.

1036
02:06:03,114 --> 02:06:05,153
Come on! Get up!

1037
02:06:18,153 --> 02:06:19,844
Hand me the shotgun.

1038
02:06:24,425 --> 02:06:26,630
Put your weight on me, Mom.

1039
02:06:27,402 --> 02:06:29,257
Hurry!

1040
02:06:32,650 --> 02:06:34,243
Come on, Mom.

1041
02:06:40,459 --> 02:06:41,736
Get up!

1042
02:07:11,911 --> 02:07:13,799
This way. Come on.

1043
02:07:41,474 --> 02:07:44,060
Wait! No. No. It's too hot.

1044
02:07:44,098 --> 02:07:45,342
Go back.

1045
02:07:53,185 --> 02:07:55,390
- Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.

1046
02:07:55,427 --> 02:07:57,369
John, you've got to go now.

1047
02:07:57,411 --> 02:07:59,516
- John!
- Go! Now!

1048
02:09:10,756 --> 02:09:12,643
Get up the steps.

1049
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:15,907
Go.

1050
02:09:19,717 --> 02:09:21,124
Get up.

1051
02:09:21,893 --> 02:09:23,932
Come on, Mom.
I got you.

1052
02:09:56,966 --> 02:09:59,235
Grab the chain. Grab it.

1053
02:10:00,550 --> 02:10:03,136
Grab it. Go. Go!

1054
02:10:13,062 --> 02:10:16,227
Mom, come on! Mom!

1055
02:11:03,367 --> 02:11:05,123
Call to John.

1056
02:11:07,783 --> 02:11:09,571
I know this hurts.

1057
02:11:11,304 --> 02:11:12,897
Call John.

1058
02:11:28,616 --> 02:11:31,168
Call to John now.

1059
02:11:33,159 --> 02:11:34,948
Fuck you.

1060
02:14:44,397 --> 02:14:45,803
Help!

1061
02:15:05,482 --> 02:15:06,529
Mom.

1062
02:15:08,648 --> 02:15:10,536
Help me.

1063
02:15:13,033 --> 02:15:14,277
Get out of the way, John.

1064
02:15:17,481 --> 02:15:17,983
Shoot!

1065
02:16:10,983 --> 02:16:13,349
Get down!

1066
02:17:42,793 --> 02:17:44,898
Get up. Come on.

1067
02:17:47,049 --> 02:17:48,805
Holy shit.

1068
02:17:48,842 --> 02:17:51,208
I need a vacation.

1069
02:18:03,881 --> 02:18:06,599
Is it dead?

1070
02:18:06,634 --> 02:18:08,041
Terminated.

1071
02:18:11,274 --> 02:18:12,964
Will this melt in there?

1072
02:18:15,786 --> 02:18:17,608
Yes. Throw it in.

1073
02:18:22,090 --> 02:18:23,073
Adios.

1074
02:18:24,393 --> 02:18:26,280
And the chip.

1075
02:18:40,810 --> 02:18:42,370
It's over.

1076
02:18:48,907 --> 02:18:50,532
There's one more chip.

1077
02:18:54,987 --> 02:18:57,191
And it must be destroyed also.

1078
02:19:02,379 --> 02:19:03,940
Here.

1079
02:19:03,980 --> 02:19:07,276
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

1080
02:19:19,851 --> 02:19:22,241
I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.

1081
02:19:22,283 --> 02:19:24,520
No, it'll be okay.
Stay with us.

1082
02:19:24,555 --> 02:19:26,530
- It'll be okay.
- I have to go away.

1083
02:19:26,572 --> 02:19:29,092
No, don't do it.
Please, don't go.

1084
02:19:29,131 --> 02:19:32,099
I must go away, John.

1085
02:19:32,140 --> 02:19:33,601
No, wait.

1086
02:19:33,645 --> 02:19:35,106
You don't have to do this.

1087
02:19:35,149 --> 02:19:36,457
I'm sorry.

1088
02:19:37,325 --> 02:19:39,528
No, don't do it! Don't go!

1089
02:19:39,564 --> 02:19:41,451
It has to end here.

1090
02:19:42,605 --> 02:19:47,727
I order you not to go!

1091
02:19:53,388 --> 02:19:55,362
I know now why you cry.

1092
02:19:57,645 --> 02:20:00,034
But it's something
I can never do.

1093
02:20:32,910 --> 02:20:35,048
Goodbye.

1094
02:22:10,027 --> 02:22:12,994
<i>The unknown future
rolls toward us.</i>

1095
02:22:13,036 --> 02:22:16,833
<i>l face it for the first time
with a sense of hope.</i>

1096
02:22:16,876 --> 02:22:19,177
<i>Because if a machine,
a Terminator...</i>

1097
02:22:19,212 --> 02:22:22,507
<i>can learn the value
of human life...</i>

1098
02:22:22,540 --> 02:22:24,907
<i>maybe we can too.</i>
